Personality Syndrome. Persyn for short.

Persyn makes it easy to integrate cutting-edge machine learning research projects into a single microservices framework. Each project implements a component of a greater personality (speech, language model, long-term memory, visualizations, logic) that is tied together into an interactive group chat interface via Slack.

The resulting gestalt can be executed on any combination of local compute resources (CPU + GPU) and third-party APIs (OpenAI, ConceptNet, online dictionaries, Twitter, etc.)

The name "Personality Syndrome" was chosen by the first proto-Persyn instance itself, @AnnaTheBot.
